What a great idea for a useful future function!
Lucky me, I will have it to use in the future since I have a forked copy.
It would be helpful to specify that the initial salary amount should be annual.
Code was clear and easy to follow
PEP8online complained that you didn't leave a blank line at the end of the file.
Nicely done.
